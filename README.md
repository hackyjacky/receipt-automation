This is a script I created to automate the process of generating receipts and issuing them to freshmen who purchased different bundles of items during registration for the annual Metamorphosis orientation camp held in SMU. The code reads data from a Google Sheet using Sheets API, then annotates a blank PDF receipt template with purchase details using the pdf-annotate library, emails it to the freshmen through SMTP module, and converts the receipt from PDF to image using PyMuPDF. Finally, the code uploads the image to a Google Document using Docs API and updates various other google sheets for bookkeeping.
